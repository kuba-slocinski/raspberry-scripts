# This program logs a Raspberry Pi's CPU temperature to a Thingspeak Channel
# To use, get a Thingspeak.com account, set up a channel, and capture the Channel Key at https://thingspeak.com/docs/tutorials/ 
# Then paste your channel ID in the code for the value of "key" below.
# Then run as sudo python pitemp.py (access to the CPU temp requires sudo access)
# You can see my channel at https://thingspeak.com/channels/41518
